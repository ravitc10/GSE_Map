How best to close the entrenched and pernicious opportunity gaps that characterize school systems in the United States? In this first-year seminar, we will consider and debate these questions as we explore the history and politics of schooling in the U.S. over the last half-century. Topics include political movements for racial justice in schools, policy and legal efforts addressing equal opportunity, the rise of standards-based reform, school choice dilemmas, and community control of schools. Our goal is to develop a deeper understanding of the processes by which U.S. society constructs, prioritizes, and addresses education."

    "description": "The goal of this course is to help students develop concepts, tools, dispositions, and skills that will help them engage productively in the ongoing experiment of American democracy. This nation's founders created a governmental structure that sets up an ongoing and expansive conversation about how to manage the tensions and tradeoffs between competing values and notions of the public good. These tensions can never be fully resolved or eliminated; they are intrinsic to the American experiment. Every generation must struggle to find its own balance, in no small part because in every era people who previously had been unjustly excluded from the conversation find a way to be heard. That inevitably introduces new values and changes how enduring ones get interpreted. The challenge of each generation is to develop that capacity to its fullest. The goal of this course is to equip you to engage fully in your generation's renewal of the conversation. Class sessions will use a variety of modalities: lecture, discussion, case studies, opportunities to experiment with the tools and techniques of civil dialogue and writing. Each session will include some theory or historical context, a case study, exploration of a key concept of civic dialogue with a related tool or technique, and an interactive exercise. This course is part of a larger effort by the university (called the Paideia program) to help Penn students build these skills"

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which utilizes secularized practices from Asian and South Asian traditions for the remediation of various health concerns, has revolutionized behavioral medicine, and the scientific evaluation of MBSR has shed new light on the biomechanical pathways linking mind and body. This course will 1) explore fundamental principles underlying mindfulness, 2) the scientific data on its effects, and 3) the ways in which mindfulness is being applied to clinical and educational settings to support healthy human development. Contemplative practices include all forms of meditation, including contemplative dimensions of yoga, tai chi, qigong and other mind-body wellness activities. By far the most well known contemplative practice in the U.S. today is \"mindfulness.\" Mindfulness meditation was introduced into clinical medicine in the 1980's in the form of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) by Jon Kabat-Zinn and his colleagues at U Mass; since that time it has had a significant impact on psychoneuroimmunology, clinical medicine, and especially behavioral medicine. Both psychological theory and practice have slowly been transformed by new findings emerging from mindfulness research. Brain imaging studies of persons engaged in meditation suggest that focused mental activities can actually change cerebral blood flow (Newberg et al 2010), brain morphology and neural circuitry, in addition to strengthening the immune system (Davidson et al 2003) and improving attention skills (Jha et al 2007). MBSR has been repeatedly documented to be effective in treating mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety, in numerous adult populations (Goyal et al 2014). Now, researchers are testing MBSR and other mindfulness approaches in children and adolescents as both a way to treat social-emotional dysfunction as well as to promote health and enhance"

Through a combination of readings, lectures, and discussions, this course will explore a broad range of topics, including language policy, language education, the Korean diaspora, gender and language dynamics, and honorifics. Guided by the central question of how language mediates social perceptions and categorizations, students will consider the complex interplay between language, cultural identities, and sociopolitical issues in Korea. By the end of the course, students will have gained a robust and holistic understanding of the multicultural and multilingual dynamics that characterize contemporary Korea and its position in the world, informed by the view of Korean as an embodied translingual practice.

They can provide both formative and summative information about a wide range of data and a wide range of stakeholders. However, learning can take many forms and does not always require (or result from) a linear path. Successful learning often requires persevering in the face of obstacles, but allowing learners to stagnate in such a space for too long can be demotivating. Likewise, we have also seen research that suggests that results in short term learning gains do not always lead to long term success. Even digital learning systems with substantial automation require data to be presented in a way that is relevant for the given stakeholders. This course explores starts with an overview of the kinds of digital learning systems currently available and a high-level view of the kinds of measurement constructs that have been modeled using their data. It then covers the kinds of motivational principles, cognitive biases, and other data visualization principles that are important to communicating different kinds of data. Finally, it culminates in the development of a novel dashboard system, the design of which students will justify both with a review of the literature and with a mini-usability study."

Yet when we speak about \"education,\" we often collapse it instantly into \"schooling.\" What if we didn't? This discussion-based course takes on that challenge. What if we look at education as it actually happens, in ways inclusive of but reaching well beyond schooling? What if we step outside the school box into which we're often putting education? What are the implications for how we think about education, about particular configurations of educating institutions in any current educational ecosystem, about public and private purposes, and about what it means to be a professional in education? How do we wrap our arms around \"education\" when it suddenly encompasses, well, all of those entities that intentionally educate us? Viewing education more broadly than schooling, we will pursue a conversation between historical and current challenges, toward understanding the present implications -- for practice, for policy, for professions -- if we were to make such a basic shift conceptually and operationally.

We focus overall on the education sector, but we begin with a broader view of complex adaptive systems and international development, drawing upon case studies about education, water, sanitation, health, savings groups, empowering the disabled, climate change and community radio, and others. There is ample room for the course to appeal to those focused on sectors other than education. We build upon a deep discussion of the complexity of development contexts. Next, we turn to systems thinking and \"theories of change.\" We ultimately go deepest into educational processes, politics, systems and outcomes. Concerns for governance and accountability have increased attention to \"systems thinking\" in the design and implementation of public services, including education plans and educational reform; therefore, reformers must grasp the range of meanings of an \"education system\" as complex, multidimensional processes, interactions, and institutional structures. Students will learn to use systems thinking to approach, define, understand and analyze the biggest challenges to improving social outcomes--so called \"wicked problems\"."

    "course_title": "Decolonizing Education",
    "description": "Frantz Fanon (1963) writes that decolonization \"sets out to change the order of the world.\" This course approaches decolonization in and around Education not as a \"metaphor\" for \"civil and human rights-based social justice projects\" couched in diversity, inclusion, and equity (Tuck and Yang 2012), but as part of a range of political projects and experiments that have sought to fundamentally reorder global structures, systems, and relations of power. Though prevailing philosophies about the meaning and purpose of Education cast schooling as a critical pathway to democratic, socially just, and inclusive societies, the historical foundations and contemporary realities of formal education in the Global South complicate theses ideals. For much of the formerly colonized world, Western education was one of the earliest and most enduring imperial projects, which deliberately undermined indigenous systems of knowing and learning in order to produce \"good\" subjects for incorporation into colonial regimes. Despite the promises of post-colonial nationhood, in most parts of the world, education still retains this function as the primary instrument of elite re/production and social stratification. And, yet, education is also typically imagined as central to decolonial and anti-imperial projects, improving social conditions, and forms of social and political belonging. This course interrogates histories and contemporary realities related to the politics and possibilities of Education from the vantage point of the Global South, which here signals a geography of relative geopolitical power indexing relations of development/underdevelopment, core/periphery, and empire/colony. By considering the various ways education has been part of decolonizing projects, we will investigate the relationships between education and indigenous ways of knowing and learning, colonialism, nationalism, conflict, class re/production, spatial and social mobilities, among other thematic strands. Moreover, in centering the periphery, we will explore the theoretical openings that \"theory from the (Global) South\" offers for decolonial epistemologies and pedagogies."

This course also explores how ethics should be taught in schools (and if it should be taught at all). The course raises and engages with the following questions: How can educators approach ethical dilemmas in their everyday work? How might an educator respond when she believes school-based policies and procedures are not in a student's best interest? How might an educator balance responses to particular events with system's level transformation? Should policy makers pander to upper-middle class parents to attract them to urban districts? How can individual teachers and entire schools teach ethics?"

    "description": "Is the purpose of education to allow individuals to better themselves by pursuing personal tastes and interests, or should education be primarily aimed at creating good citizens or good members of a group? Is there a way of reconciling these two aims? Assuming that adult relations with children are inherently paternalistic, is it possible for children to be educated for future autonomy to pursue major life goals free from such paternalistic control; and if so, how? How much, if any control over education can be allocated to the state, even when this conflicts with the educational goals parents have for their children? Such questions are especially relevant in multicultural or pluralistic societies in which some groups within a liberal state are non-liberal. Should a liberal democratic state intervene in education to ensure the development of children's personal autonomy, or must toleration of non-liberal groups prevail even at the expense of children's autonomy?"

    "course_title": "History of American Education",
    "description": "This course will examine the growth and development of American schools, from the colonial era into the present. By 1850, the United States sent a greater fraction of its children to school than any other nation on earth. Why? What did young people learn there? And, most of all, how did these institutions both reflect and shape our evolving conceptions of “America” itself? In an irreducibly diverse society, the answers were never simple. Americans have always defined their nation in a myriad of contrasting and often contradictory ways. So they have also clashed vehemently over their schools, which remain our central public vehicle for deliberating and disseminating the values that we wish to transmit to our young. Our course will pay close attention to these education-related debates, especially in the realms of race, class, and religion. When immigrants came here from other shores, would they have to relinquish their old cultures and languages? When African-Americans won their freedom from bondage, what status would they assume? And as different religious denominations fanned out across the country, how would they balance the uncompromising demands of faith with the pluralistic imperatives of democracy? All of these questions came into relief at school, where the answers changed dramatically over time. Early American teachers blithely assumed that newcomers would abandon their old-world habits and tongues; today, “multicultural education” seeks to preserve or even to celebrate these distinctive patterns. Post-emancipation white philanthropists designed vocational curricula for freed African-Americans, imagining blacks as loyal serfs; but Black citizens demanded a more academic education, which would set them on the road to equality. Protestants and Catholics both used the public schools to teach their faith systems until the early 1960s, when the courts barred them from doing so; but religious controversies continue to hound the schools, especially on matters like evolution and sex education. How should our public schools address such dilemmas? How can the schools provide a “common” education, as Horace Mann called it, melding us into an integrated whole while still respecting our inevitable differences?"

    "description": "What constitutes merit? What should constitute merit? These questions are both philosophical and practical - and are faced by every educator in some form. The notion of meritocracy has long been at the heart of varied discourses about the place of education in American society. Merit is most often understood as inhering in consistent and individual personality traits such as competency, intelligence, and diligence. And yet, every individual is embedded in complex social worlds that are culturally specific and historically contingent. Drawing on a broad array of disciplines and literatures, this seminar-style course challenges students to consider how ideas of merit and its measurement are shaped by American history, culture, and society, and to articulate their own views as they move toward their professional goals."

Since the founding of the Republic, we have battled over religion, sex, gender, and race. And many of these conflicts have entered our schools, which remain our primary vehicle for deliberating and determining who we are. What languages should we use in school? What should we teach young people about sex? About race? About religion? Most of all, what stories should we tell about the nation itself? This course will probe these issues and also help students write primary-source research papers that examine different culture wars in American education."

Together, we will explore how to form the coalition(s), theory, and praxes necessary to transform social conditions. In the first part of the course, we critically examine theories of power, resistance, and liberatory transformation to share knowledges and a build a critical vocabulary with which we will investigate the contested rhetorical and political terrain of our present moment. The notion of praxis, a guiding principle of the course, signals the processes through which \"theory\" is both embodied and realized. As such, in the second part of the course, we will experiment with how theory can be brought to bear on contemporary struggles around education--and, conversely, how the practices of activism can inform our learning, scholarship, and pedagogies. ABC is an Academically Based Community Service course supported by the Netter Center for Community Partnerships.

Students are required to put theory into practice by conducting ethnographic research and producing an ethnographic film as their final project. In service to that goal, students will read about ethnography (as a social scientific method and representational genre), learn and utilize ethnographic methods in fieldwork, watch non-fiction films (to be analyzed for formal properties and implicit assumptions about culture/sociality), and acquire rigorous training in the skills and craft of digital video production. This is an ABCS course, and students will produce short ethnographic films with students in Philadelphia high schools as part of a partnership project with the School District of Philadelphia.

Students receive advanced training in film and video for social change. A project-based service-learning course, students collaborate with Philadelphia high school students and community groups to make films and videos that encourage creative self-expression and represent issues important to youth, schools, and local communities. Stories and themes on emotional well-being, safety, health, environmental issues, racism and social justice are particularly encouraged. A central thread throughout is to assess and reflect upon the strengths (and weaknesses) of contemporary film (digital, online) in fostering debate, discussion and catalyzing community action and social change. The filmmaking medium and process itself is explored as a means to engage and interact with communities. This course provides a grounding in theories, concepts, methods and practices of community engagement derived from Community Participatory Video, Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) and Ethnographic methods. For the very first time, Penn students will be trained to operate a state-of-the-art TV studio at PSTV (Philadelphia Schools TV). At the end of the semester approved films will be screened with an accompanying panel discussion at an event at the School District of Philadelphia (SDP). These films will also be broadcast on Comcast Philadelphia's PSTV Channel 52 and webcast via the district's website and YouTube channel.

Stereotype threat is linked with impostor phenomenon. Impostor phenomenon is an internal experience of intellectual phoniness in authentically talented individuals, in which they doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as a fraud. While stereotype threat relies on broad generalization, the impostor phenomenon describes feelings of personal inadequacy, especially in high-achieving African Americans.

We examine, as well, the unusual talents and intellectual strengths that many ASD individuals exhibit. Students interested in working with individuals on the autism spectrum in educational and counseling settings will gain insight into: • How autism spectrum disorders affect the acquisition of social and academic skills • The availability and efficacy of different types of interventions and accommodations • Issues relating to neurodiversity and disability rights • Strategies for guiding students with autism spectrum disorders through K12 schools and beyond"

    "description": "The social and political context, the expectations for higher education, and the consumers of post-secondary learning and credentials are changing dramatically in ways that deeply impact the operation of our colleges and universities, the student experience, and the outcomes that result. Why then are learning institutions – ostensibly designed to teach evolving knowledge, nurture open-minded curiosity, and model continuous improvement-- so hard to change, even in small ways? How can we manage the facilitation of change despite institutional inertia? This course is grounded in research and theory on how higher education leaders, at all levels and in all types of institutions, can lead the change process, with close attention to practical, proven strategies from within and outside higher education."

    "description": "This course is a collaborative inquiry into the dynamic concept of adolescent literacy and its potential as an organizing construct for improving teaching and learning. It provides opportunities to investigate a variety of resources including our own histories as well as a range of print, digital and visual texts and to conduct fieldwork in various middle and secondary school classrooms where youth are being positioned (and positioning themselves) as literacy learners and literacy is being defined, performed, practiced, interrogated, and interpreted, within and beyond the school curricula. By engaging with youth, in various texts and contexts and for a range of purposes, participants will try to make sense of how adolescents negotiate their worlds, in school and out. The approach to literacy is interdisciplinary, drawing from the domains of literature, composition, linguistics, curriculum theory, anthropology and psychology and from theory, research and practice of both university-based and school-based teachers, writers and researchers. The intent is to pose and refine questions about what it means to teach literacy in ways that take seriously what youth bring to school as their own knowledge and passions, cultural and linguistic resources."

The learning sciences is a relatively new field of research in education that began in the late 80s. It is an interdisciplinary field consisting of researchers who study among other things, cognition, science and math education, language literacy, anthropological and sociological perspectives, computer science, and educational psychology. Learning scientists study learning as it happens in real world contexts and design resources and environments to improve learning in those contexts. This can happen in school, in informal places, at work, and online. Although the learning sciences is continually evolving, what remains true of the tenets of this educational field is that learning happens through mediated processes that most often require collaboration with others whereby learning is inextricably linked to context and culture.

In this course we address critical questions: How can technology applications be supportive of second language learning and teaching for young and adult learners? What works and what doesn't work? What evidence do we have? To answer these questions, we bring together research and design two academic fields: (1) Theories and instructional approaches for teaching and learning a second language; and (2) Theories and designs using technologies for learning and teaching. Our goal is to examine how the integration of these two efforts can result in more supportive and effective learning and teaching in a time, in which technologies provide new opportunities and challenges for second language learning and teaching."

    "description": "This graduate seminar is a capstone course in the Reading, Writing, and Literacy master's program, designed to help students develop understandings about key theoretical underpinnings of literacy research. As a foundational course, the seminar will explore how literacy has been conceptualized over time and across disciplines, examining how literacy has functioned as a touchstone issue in policy and practice as people debate what 'counts' as literacy. While we explore these debates, we focus particularly on contemporary literacy theories that understand literacy to be multiple, ideological, and socially situated - practices grounded in specific contexts that are fundamentally linked to broader social, cultural, and political power structures. Inquiry sits at the heart of the course, with students developing an online learning portfolio centered around their individual research, course readings, and prior experiences. Students will reflect on their RWL program of study, write about conceptual territories at the heart of the program, and curate materials from the semester and their program of study to demonstrate their learning and development over time. Students will work with coaches as well as engage in a workshop learning environment, culminating in an online learning portfolio and presentation to RWL faculty."

It provides opportunities to investigate a variety of resources including our own histories as well as a range of print, digital and visual texts and to conduct fieldwork in various middle and secondary school classrooms where youth are being positioned (and positioning themselves) as literacy learners and literacy is being defined, performed, practiced, interrogated, and interpreted, within and beyond the school curricula. By engaging with youth, in various texts and contexts and for a range of purposes, participants will try to make sense of how adolescents negotiate their worlds, in school and out. The approach to literacy is interdisciplinary, drawing from the domains of literature, composition, linguistics, curriculum theory, anthropology and psychology and from theory, research and practice of both university-based and school-based teachers, writers and researchers. The intent is to pose and refine questions about what it means to teach literacy in ways that take seriously what youth bring to school as their own knowledge and passions, cultural and linguistic resources."

Developmental science’s increasing attention to early child development and its implications for learning and teaching point to the need and the potential to improve the education and well-being of all young children. Such attention is especially significant for children and families in marginalized and historically disenfranchised communities. In studying the broad dimensions of education and schooling, early childhood specialists draw from fields as different as neurobiology and housing to areas traditionally associated with young children’s learning and schooling, e.g., literacy and language. Despite the heightened awareness regarding the problems and incremental change in the circumstances of some children, our responses to the issues fall short of understanding the complexity of dilemmas or addressing the multiplicity and depth of need facing young children and the diversity of families and communities of care who support their education, health, safety, and well-being."

It begins with an overview of how evidence is used in three phases of reform or intervention: design, implementation, and impact. It offers a framework for thinking about where research questions are in a project cycle. Students will be asked to systematically consider who is asking the question and the implications of the answer for whether and how evidence is used. The course uses real cases from international education to explore key topics, such as: structured pedagogy, education technology, bi- and multi-lingual classrooms, time on task, equity, learning materials, school readiness, social-emotional learning, girls education, parents’ roles in learning, teaching at the right level, and scaling. With each topic, the class will read current evidence syntheses and explore the production and use of evidence in at least one real-world setting. Guest speakers from several of these efforts will share their experience and engage the class in learning in more depth about evidence use in ongoing reforms. We’ll explore concepts of replicability, external validity and evidence use in adaptative management. Students will also learn about the types of outcome measures commonly used in generating this evidence – assessments of basic reading and math skills, holistic child development and social-emotional, or “21st century skills” – as well as some of their challenges. They will learn about measures commonly used to capture implementation fidelity and quality of learning environments. Students will become familiar with current debates in international basic education and child development. They will know the current state of the evidence that underpins these debates, and the measures used to move these fields of inquiry forward. Assignments will challenge students to analyze evidence and interventions, as well as to design studies to move the field forward."

Specifically, through a series of theoretical lenses, we will question how social formations like democracy, capitalism, race, feminism, and networked publics have attempted to define the goals and substance of educational endeavors. Additionally, we will consider the implications of the social foundations of teaching and learning for our own work as educational scholars and practitioners."

Special emphasis will be given to develop research proposal that address gaps detected in the literature pertaining to issues and factors affecting students' transitions from high school to college and to the job market. The ultimate goal of the coursework is to critically analyze and have informed opinions of the state of knowledge regarding factors affecting students' college choice, access, and success, as well as how these choices impact their job market prospects. Course Description and Objectives: This course examines existing research on the analysis of college access and success, the transition from high school to college, community colleges, labor market opportunities, and the policies, interventions, and initiatives that have been developed to address inequities and inequities in students' college plans, academic preparation, and financial access. Particular attention will be paid to issues of poverty, race, and ethnicity. The topics studied are informed by sociological, economic, and anthropological theories. Given that community colleges enroll close to 50% of total undergraduate students, and serve as the primary provider of college education for underrepresented, first-generation, low-income, and minoritized students, their role as a potential equalizing engine in the American higher education system will be studied. Specifically, we will study the diverse set of theoretical frameworks and methods that researchers have been using to understand these institutions and will assess the extensive evidence we have to date regarding their effects on education and labor market outcomes. Expectations: Students are expected to be engaged intellectual thinkers and active participants in the pursuit of knowledge, not just passive recipients of information. This course is reading intensive and the majority of class time will be spent in a seminar format discussing the assigned readings. There will be opportunities for students to take turns leading discussion sessions using a set of guiding questions generated by the students own creative and original thinking with the help of the instructor. These student-professor led discussion sessions will occupy about half of our class time while the other half will be lecture and presentation by the instructor along with presentation of work in progress of final papers to gain collective feedback."

    "course_title": "Spatial Socio-Econometric Modeling",
    "description": "Despite the vast availability of data that can be linked to earth’s surface (AKA geo- referenced or geo-located), most research continue to ignore or omit the influence of location on the outcomes of interest. For example, assume one is interested in measuring the impact of an intervention taking place in some school districts across a given state. Assume further that a variety of school-level administrative indicators are readily available for model inclusion, whereas other place-based indicators require extra data gathering, management, and methods before they can be statistically accounted for. In scenarios like this, researchers typically proceed to model the intervention effects without considering other place-based variables that surely impact students’ performance over and above their within school experiences. That is, given that where individuals experiences life transcends school boundaries, the omission of out-of-school localized factors such as neighborhood-level poverty, crime, or unemployment levels, equates to ignoring and/or assuming that those factors bear no effect on such individuals’ prospects of success. The overarching purpose of this course is threefold. First, it discusses the most recent theories on neighborhood effects, equality of opportunity and environmental determinism as the foundations for the applications and methods covered in the course. Second, the course moves to introduce a survey of geolocated data sources that can be incorporated in traditional socio-econometric research. Third, the course provides participants with tools and methods to visualize and model datasets with spatial elements in order to reach conclusions and offer recommendations that consider the relevance of place and space. It is hoped that the incorporation of these place-based indicators may provide more robust and precise evidence, (as) compared to evidence reached with methods that ignore such a structure contained in places where units of analyses are spatially situated."

The supervised internship, involving placement of the student in an approved field site, is individually designed and is subject to approval; students must submit a Proposal describing their ethnographic project in the semester prior to undertaking fieldwork as a requirement of EDUC 7220 : Seminar in Microethnography. This course offers guidance as students complete the portfolio or reflective paper, which is based on their experience and the ethnographic data they collected during their fieldwork placement. Through this course, students in the M.S.Ed. LGIS program will discuss ways to conceptualize their fieldwork experience, situate it meaningfully within the field of Language, Globalization, and Intercultural Studies, locate and analyze relevant research literature, and prepare the portfolio or reflective paper, with an overall goal of developing the ability to communicate clearly and effectively for an academic and/or professional audience. Prerequisite: Eight or more courses toward M. S. Ed. degree in Language, Globalization, and Intercultural Studies. Permission needed from department."

    "description": "This course is designed as a collaborative inquiry toward constructing and elaborating theories of practice as teachers and/or researchers of reading. Using a seminar or working group format, participants explore the relationships among theory, reading, practice, pedagogy and research. The course's conceptualization is informed primarily by (1) frameworks from critical, feminist and culturally-centered literatures which foreground issues of equity, representation, and ethics; and (2) current conversations in the field of literacy where the definitions, purposes, and practices of reading have been made problematic. It also invites participants to engage the notion that knowledge for teaching and research comes from inquiry into the questions, issues, and contradictions that arise from everyday life. The course provides historical lenses for comparative analyses of theoretical frameworks and research paradigms as well as opportunities to investigate participants' individual histories as well as teaching and research interests. Fall, even numbered years only"

The course themes include causal inference, vulnerability of models applied to observational data, recent developments computer-intensive inductive approaches to data, and related matters. Although some methodological background papers will be discussed, the seminar is case study oriented with readings from contemporary research on the topics from peer reviewed journals and well-vetted reports issued by governmental and nongovernment agencies. Cases will include work supported by IES on effects of Odyssey Math, for example, and work in the crime and justice arena. We will study the work of scholars affiliated with Penn who are actively involved in randomized and non-randomized trials, for instance, and the work of colleagues at other universities (Berkeley, Northwestern, Wisconsin, Princeton, others) and colleagues in non-profit and for profit research organizations such as Analytica, AIR, Mathematica and others that contribute to learning in this arena."

The course pays special attention to: i) the use of causal research designs in answering questions relevant for policy, and ii) the application of economic principles to issues in education. The course is designed as a seminar for Ph.D. students to build skills in critiquing studies that employ experimental and quasi-experimental methods, such as randomized control trials, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, etc. The papers covered in the course will examine questions in education policy through the perspective of economics and issues related to trade-offs, incentives, the analytic process, and the distribution of costs and benefits. Students will also be asked to consider applications of these methods and their related assumptions, in their own work. The course is intended for students who have a solid understanding of methods typically used in econometrics or statistics to estimate causal effects. Prerequisite: This course is primarily intended for Ph.D. students who have taken or who are currently taking a course on experimental and quasi-experimental methods of causal inference and who have had an introductory course in economic perspectives in education research."
